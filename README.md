# Fraud-Transaction-detection-System

Objective:
Our idea aims to develop a fraud detection system for financial transactions that can accurately identify fraudulent activities and prevent potential losses. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and advanced data analytics techniques, we aim to create a robust and effective solution that enhances security and trust in financial transactions.
Implementation:
To implement our idea, we gathered a comprehensive dataset of financial transactions that included various features such as transaction type, amount, time, source, destination, and additional contextual information. We preprocessed and analyzed the data, performed feature engineering to extract relevant information, and trained a machine learning model on the labeled data to detect fraudulent transactions. We used a combination of supervised learning techniques, such as logistic regression, decision trees, or ensemble methods like XGBoost, to train the model. The model learned from historical data patterns and characteristics of fraudulent transactions to make predictions on new, unseen transactions. We evaluated the performance of the model using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and fine-tuned the model parameters to optimize its performance. The best accuracy was obtained by XGBoost.
Applications:
The developed fraud detection system has various applications in the financial industry, including banking, e-commerce, payment gateways, and insurance sectors. It can be integrated into existing transaction processing systems to provide real-time fraud detection capabilities, enabling timely intervention and prevention of fraudulent activities. The system can help financial institutions identify and block suspicious transactions, protect customers from fraudulent activities, and minimize financial losses. It can also assist in fraud investigations by providing insights into fraudulent patterns and identifying potential perpetrators.
Final Result:
Evaluation Metrics: We evaluated the performance of our models on the training, validation, and test datasets using various metrics. Here are the evaluation results:

For Model Trained on df:
Test Set:
o Accuracy: 0.9889
o F1 Score: 0.9890
o ROC AUC Score: 0.9889

For Model Trained on df2:
Test Set:
o Accuracy: 0.9867
o F1 Score: 0.9868
o ROC AUC Score: 0.9867

Analysis: Based on the evaluation metrics, it can be observed that the model trained on df (which includes all transaction types) outperformed the model trained on df2 (which only considers transfers and cash outs) in terms of accuracy and F1 score. This indicates that including other transaction types in the training data helped improve the model's performance. Furthermore, both models demonstrated high accuracy and F1 scores on both the validation and test sets, indicating their effectiveness in detecting fraudulent transactions. The ROC AUC scores also suggest that the models have good discriminatory power.

Feature Importance: By analyzing the feature importances using XGBoost, we identified the following insights:
The most important feature for the model's prediction was diffOrg, followed by oldbalanceOrg, amount, and newbalanceDest.
Surprisingly, the feature isFlaggedFraud did not contribute significantly to the model's prediction, likely due to its low number of positive examples.
The feature diffDest had higher sample coverage and weight compared to CASH_IN, but its gain was lower, which was unexpected.
The weight of the feature step was relatively high, but its gain was comparatively lower, possibly due to the uniform distribution of fraud transactions across different steps.

Future Development:
To further enhance the fraud detection system, we can consider the following steps:
Collect more transaction data: Gathering additional data, especially on fraudulent transactions, can help improve the model's performance and robustness.
Explore advanced techniques: Investigate advanced machine learning techniques such as anomaly detection algorithms or deep learning models to potentially uncover more complex fraud patterns and enhance the system's detection capabilities.
Continuously update the model: Keep updating the model with new data to ensure it remains effective against evolving fraud techniques. Regular retraining and fine-tuning of the model can help maintain its accuracy and adaptability.
Collaborate with industry experts: Collaborate with financial institutions, industry experts, and cybersecurity professionals to incorporate domain-specific knowledge, share insights, and stay updated on emerging fraud trends. This collaboration will help build a more comprehensive and powerful fraud detection solution.

Overall, our objective is to create a sustainable and continuously improving fraud detection system that contributes to a safer and more secure financial ecosystem.
